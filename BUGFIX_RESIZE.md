# Bug Fix: Resize Handles for Shapes and Text

## Issue
Resize handles (white squares at corners) were not working for shape and text objects. Only image objects were resizing correctly.

## Root Cause
The resize logic was trying to update the `size` property for shapes, but shapes are drawn as geometric shapes using `width` and `height` properties directly, not the `size` property.

For text objects, the logic was also not properly handling the recalculation of dimensions after resizing.

## Fix Applied

### Changes in `canvas-interactions.js`:

1. **Added `elementStartSize` to drag state** (line ~78)
   - Stores the initial `size` property when resize starts
   - Used to calculate proportional size changes

2. **Simplified resize logic** (lines ~185-210)
   - **For Images**: Maintain aspect ratio, update width/height ✅
   - **For Shapes**: Just update width/height (geometric shapes) ✅
   - **For Text**: Update size property AND recalculate dimensions ✅

### Specific Changes:

```javascript
// Before (broken):
- Tried to update size for shapes (unnecessary)
- Didn't properly recalculate text dimensions
- Used current size instead of initial size for calculations

// After (fixed):
- Shapes: Only update width/height
- Text: Update size, then recalculate dimensions
- Use dragState.elementStartSize for proportional calculations
```

## Testing

### Test Shapes:
1. Add a shape (circle, square, or arrow)
2. Drag any corner handle
3. ✅ Shape should resize smoothly
4. ✅ Width and height should update in panel

### Test Text:
1. Add a styled text object
2. Drag any corner handle
3. ✅ Text should resize (font size changes)
4. ✅ Size field should update in panel

### Test Images:
1. Add an image/person
2. Drag any corner handle
3. ✅ Image should resize maintaining aspect ratio
4. ✅ Height field should update in panel

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All object types now resize correctly with corner handles.

## Files Modified
- `canvas-interactions.js` - Updated resize logic in mousemove handler
